<h1>Travel Bag Fee Calculator</h1>

The Travel Bag Fee Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate the total cost of their baggage fees when traveling. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs in any modern web browser.

<h2>Features</h2>
The calculator includes the following features:

<li>Input fields for the number of travelers, number of bags, and number of trips per year</li>
<li>Automatic calculation of the total cost of the first bag fee and the total cost of the second bag fee (if applicable)</li>
<li>Display of the total bag fee per year based on the user's inputs</li>

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the calculator, simply enter the number of travelers, number of bags (1 or 2), and number of trips per year into the corresponding input fields. The calculator will automatically calculate the total cost of the bag fees based on the following rules:

<li>The first bag fee costs $30 per person, per trip</li>
<li>The second bag fee costs $40 per person, per trip, but only applies if the user is carrying more than one bag</li>
The total bag fee per year is displayed below the input fields, and updates automatically as the user changes their inputs.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
